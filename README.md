# arrowhead-setup

This project was created from scripts that can be found found in [Arrowhead framework core project](https://github.com/arrowhead-f/core-java-spring) and [VTT-OM](https://github.com/VTT-OM/arrowhead-setup)

We divided the Arrowhead installation into two subgroups;
⋅⋅* Localclouds (install arrowhead services that it will run locally on your computer and Raspberry Pi)
⋅⋅* Globalclouds (install arrowhead services that it will be reachable over a static ip or a DNS name)

The main purpose of this division is pointing how the Arrowhead installations are differ between local and static ip or DNS especially on installation, certification, accessing management ui. All the installations depends on the docker.
