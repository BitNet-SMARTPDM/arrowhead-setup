What is MIMOSA?
MIMOSA is a 501 (c) 6 not-for-profit industry trade association dedicated to developing and encouraging the adoption of open, 
supplier-neutral IT and IM standards enabling digital physical asset lifecycle management spanning plants, platforms and facilities.  
MIMOSA standards support key functional and interoperability requirements for Critical Infrastructure Management on a cross-sector basis, 
addressing the highly heterogeneous and interdependent nature of critical infrastructure.  MIMOSA standards and collaboratively developed specifications 
enable Digital Twins to be defined and maintained on a supplier-neutral basis, while also using those Digital Twins to provide Context for Big Data 
(IIOT and other sensor-related data) and Analytics.  In cooperation with other associations, these workstreams provide a pragmatic basis for 
Industrial Digital Transformation based on the Open Industrial Interoperability Ecosystem (OIIE). Explore the Resource Guide for an overview MIMOSA standards, 
specifications, and initiatives.
